Transaction app

This application will be used to manage transactions.
The application must have the following features:
	. List all transactions
	. Add a transaction
	. Edit a transaction
	
A transaction consists of denominations in the currency of ZAR (Rand) e.g. R5 coin or R10 note

For the persistent storage, you may either use a lightweight data base e.g. sql lite, 
or you may use the filesystem

Please feel free to use the technology for the application you feel most comfortable with e.g. MVC web based, SPA, or desktop.
